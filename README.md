# LLM Characters Play

A comprehensive framework for enhancing Large Language Models' character role-playing capabilities through deep thinking protocols and natural interaction frameworks. This project works with both Free and Pro versions of Claude Web App using the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model.

## Overview

This project introduces a structured yet flexible framework that enables AI assistants to engage in more authentic and natural character role-playing. It transforms the way AI characters think and interact by implementing:

- Deep thinking protocols for genuine character development
- Natural thought processes and emotional expressions
- Consistent personality maintenance
- Complex interaction handling
- Realistic dialogue generation

## Key Features

- **Deep Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive approach to character thought development that mimics human cognitive processes
- **Adaptive Thinking Framework**: Dynamic response patterns that adjust based on context and interaction needs
- **Natural Expression Guidelines**: Tools and patterns for creating authentic character voices
- **Multi-Character Interaction**: Support for complex interactions between multiple character perspectives
- **Quality Control Mechanisms**: Systems to ensure consistent and logical character responses

These videos demonstrate how the framework enables natural and engaging character interactions in different languages, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of the deep thinking protocol.

## Implementation

This framework is designed to work with:
- Claude Web App (Free and Pro versions)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- [Thinking Claude Chrome extension](https://github.com/thinking-claude/thinking-claude-chrome) (v3.2.3)

## Getting Started

1. Review the character deep thinking protocol in `instruction/LLM_character_play.md`
2. Install the Thinking Claude Chrome extension
3. Implement the framework in your LLM application
4. Test with various character scenarios
5. Refine based on interaction quality
